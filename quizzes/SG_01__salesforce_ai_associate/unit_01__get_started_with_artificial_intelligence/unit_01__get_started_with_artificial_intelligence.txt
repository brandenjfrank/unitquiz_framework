UNIT 1: Get Started with Artificial Intelligence
==================================================

SUMMARY:
- **AI Definition**: AI allows computers to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, intuition, and reasoning.
- **Challenge in Defining AI**: Difficulties arise due to human-centric perspectives, varying intelligence among humans and animals, and fictional portrayals of AI.
- **Specialized AI**: Currently, AI systems excel in specialized tasks rather than generalized intelligence.
- **Main AI Capabilities**:
  - **Numeric Predictions**: Forecasting outcomes like weather, sales, or risk levels.
  - **Classifications**: Sorting data into categories, such as detecting fraud or classifying images.
  - **Robotic Navigation**: Navigating dynamic environments, applied in autonomous driving, logistics optimization, and robotic movements.
  - **Language Processing (NLP)**: Interpreting and generating natural language, enabling translations, summaries, and conversations.
