  "summary": "AI allows computers to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving. Definitions are difficult due to the variability in intelligence across species and portrayals in fiction. Current AI systems are specialized for tasks such as numeric prediction, classification, robotic navigation, and natural language processing.",
