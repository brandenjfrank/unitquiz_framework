  "title": "Understand the Ethical Use of Technology",
  "summary": "Ethical technology use ensures AI systems reflect fairness, inclusion, and responsible decision-making. Ethical lapses in design or deployment can unintentionally cause harm or exclusion. Salesforce promotes ethical tech by translating core values into development processes and encouraging diverse perspectives throughout the product lifecycle. Bias can arise from flawed assumptions, lack of diverse data, or team homogeneity. Fairness involves making decisions that minimize disproportionate harm and consider systemic inequality. Creating an ethical culture requires cross-functional accountability, process documentation, and a clear understanding of how users are impacted.",
