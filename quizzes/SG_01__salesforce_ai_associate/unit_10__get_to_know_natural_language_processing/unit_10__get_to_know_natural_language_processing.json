  "summary": "- **Definition**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.\n- **Applications**: Powers translation services, voice assistants, document editors, chatbots, and customer service platforms.\n- **Historical Evolution**:\n  - **1950s**: Turing Test, basic machine translation\n  - **1960s–80s**: Rule-based and knowledge-based systems\n  - **1990s–2000s**: Statistical approaches and web-scale datasets\n  - **2009–Present**: Neural networks and deep learning\n- **Key Components**:\n  - **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Transforms unstructured text into structured meaning.\n  - **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: Generates human-like language from structured data.\n- **Data Type Processing**: Converts between unstructured human language and structured formats for machine understanding.",
