UNIT 10: Get to Know Natural Language Processing
==================================================

SUMMARY:
- **Definition**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- **Applications**: Powers translation services, voice assistants, document editors, chatbots, and customer service platforms.
- **Historical Evolution**:
  - **1950s**: Turing Test, basic machine translation
  - **1960s–80s**: Rule-based and knowledge-based systems
  - **1990s–2000s**: Statistical approaches and web-scale datasets
  - **2009–Present**: Neural networks and deep learning
- **Key Components**:
  - **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Transforms unstructured text into structured meaning.
  - **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: Generates human-like language from structured data.
- **Data Type Processing**: Converts between unstructured human language and structured formats for machine understanding.
