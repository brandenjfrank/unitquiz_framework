  "summary": "- **Complex Relationships**: Neural networks allow AI systems to recognize complex relationships between input data and outcomes, crucial for sophisticated predictions.\n- **Simple vs. Complex Models**: Simple AI models assign a single importance (weight) to each input, but this oversimplifies real-world scenarios.\n- **Node Structure**: Neural networks solve this by creating multiple interconnected nodes to represent unique combinations of inputs.\n- **Biases and Weights**: Each node adjusts the final output based on biases and additional weights.\n- **Deep Learning**: Adding more layers and nodes creates \"deep learning,\" enabling the AI to discover hidden relationships by making multiple leaps of inference.\n- **Black Box Nature**: Although powerful, neural networks are often \"black boxes,\" making predictions without clear explanations.",
