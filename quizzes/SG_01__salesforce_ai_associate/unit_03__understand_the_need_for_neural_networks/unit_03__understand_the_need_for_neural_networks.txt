UNIT 3: Understand the Need for Neural Networks
==================================================

SUMMARY:
- **Complex Relationships**: Neural networks allow AI systems to recognize complex relationships between input data and outcomes, crucial for sophisticated predictions.
- **Simple vs. Complex Models**: Simple AI models assign a single importance (weight) to each input, but this oversimplifies real-world scenarios.
- **Node Structure**: Neural networks solve this by creating multiple interconnected nodes to represent unique combinations of inputs.
- **Biases and Weights**: Each node adjusts the final output based on biases and additional weights.
- **Deep Learning**: Adding more layers and nodes creates "deep learning," enabling the AI to discover hidden relationships by making multiple leaps of inference.
- **Black Box Nature**: Although powerful, neural networks are often "black boxes," making predictions without clear explanations.
