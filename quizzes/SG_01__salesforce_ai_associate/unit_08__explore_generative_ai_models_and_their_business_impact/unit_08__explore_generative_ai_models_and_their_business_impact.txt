UNIT 8: Explore Generative AI Models and Their Business Impact
==================================================

SUMMARY:
- **Model Types**:
  - **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**: Use generator and discriminator in competition to produce realistic content.
  - **Transformers**: Process sequential data for context-rich output generation.
  - **VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)**: Compress and reconstruct data to generate varied outputs.
  - **Autoregressive Models**: Generate sequences by predicting the next element from previous ones.
  - **Diffusion Models**: Learn to reverse noise processes to generate detailed data.
- **Success Requirements**: Data quality, computational power, model design, evaluation metrics, iteration, and ethical use.
- **Business Applications**: Revolutionizing industries such as pharmaceuticals, retail, entertainment, finance, automotive, and technology.
- **Popular Tools**: Include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and more.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Hallucinations, confident failures, data bias, misinformation, and sustainability concerns.
