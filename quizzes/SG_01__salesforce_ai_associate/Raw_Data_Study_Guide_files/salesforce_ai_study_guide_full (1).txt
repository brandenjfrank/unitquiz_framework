### Unit 2 : Turn Data into Models ###
### Summary ###
Artificial Intelligence models are increasingly built using Machine Learning (ML)—training systems with data rather than manually coded rules.
ML adjusts weights based on historical data. Structured data supports supervised learning, while unstructured data supports unsupervised learning.

### Questions ###
Question 1: Why is Machine Learning sometimes preferable to hand-coded algorithms?
A) Because ML requires less math.
B) Because ML is always faster.
C) Because some tasks have too many rules and exceptions to manually code.
D) Because laws mandate the use of ML.
Answer: C

### Unit 16 : Learn About Einstein Bots ###
### Summary ###
Einstein Bots are Salesforce’s AI-powered chatbots that automate customer interactions using Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
They deflect routine cases, support branding, and improve service efficiency when properly planned and connected to service infrastructure.

### Questions ###
Question 1: What is a chatbot?
A) A database that tracks words in and out
B) A robot that simulates people talking
C) An application that simulates human conversation
D) Software that records human conversations and plays them back
Answer: C

Question 2: Why is it important to set up case management and service channels before enabling Einstein Bots?
A) So bots can run faster.
B) To ensure fallback options are available when a bot cannot resolve an issue.
C) Because bots cannot function without phone support.
D) To meet Salesforce licensing requirements.
Answer: B
