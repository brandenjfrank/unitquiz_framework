### Unit 2 : Turn Data into Models ###
### Summary ###
Artificial Intelligence models are increasingly built using Machine Learning (ML)—training systems with data rather than manually coded rules.
ML adjusts weights based on historical data. Structured data supports supervised learning, while unstructured data supports unsupervised learning.

### Questions ###
Question 1: Why is Machine Learning sometimes preferable to hand-coded algorithms?
A) Because ML requires less math.
B) Because ML is always faster.
C) Because some tasks have too many rules and exceptions to manually code.
D) Because laws mandate the use of ML.
Answer: C

Question 2: In supervised learning, AI systems:
A) Try to find patterns without knowing the desired outcome.
B) Have clearly labeled input-output pairs to verify predictions.
C) Do not require structured data.
D) Are never accurate enough for real-world tasks.
Answer: B
