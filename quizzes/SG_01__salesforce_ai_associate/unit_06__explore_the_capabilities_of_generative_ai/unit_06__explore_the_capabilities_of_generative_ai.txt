UNIT 6: Explore the Capabilities of Generative AI
==================================================

SUMMARY:
- **Definition**: Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that can produce original and creative content like text, images, and sounds.
- **Training**: Generative AI models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), are trained on extensive datasets, such as internet pages.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - **Summarization**: Condensing large amounts of text into concise summaries.
  - **Translation**: Converting text accurately between languages.
  - **Error Correction**: Identifying and fixing grammatical or spelling errors.
  - **Question Answering**: Responding contextually and accurately to queries.
  - **Guided Image Generation**: Creating or expanding images based on textual descriptions.
  - **Text-to-Speech**: Converting text into realistic, spoken audio.
- **Nature of Responses**: Content produced by generative AI is based on sophisticated predictions rather than actual thought or intent.
