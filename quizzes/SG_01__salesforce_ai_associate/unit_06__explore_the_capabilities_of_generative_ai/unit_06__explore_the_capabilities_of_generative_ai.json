  "summary": "- **Definition**: Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that can produce original and creative content like text, images, and sounds.\n- **Training**: Generative AI models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), are trained on extensive datasets, such as internet pages.\n- **Key Capabilities**:\n  - **Summarization**: Condensing large amounts of text into concise summaries.\n  - **Translation**: Converting text accurately between languages.\n  - **Error Correction**: Identifying and fixing grammatical or spelling errors.\n  - **Question Answering**: Responding contextually and accurately to queries.\n  - **Guided Image Generation**: Creating or expanding images based on textual descriptions.\n  - **Text-to-Speech**: Converting text into realistic, spoken audio.\n- **Nature of Responses**: Content produced by generative AI is based on sophisticated predictions rather than actual thought or intent.",
