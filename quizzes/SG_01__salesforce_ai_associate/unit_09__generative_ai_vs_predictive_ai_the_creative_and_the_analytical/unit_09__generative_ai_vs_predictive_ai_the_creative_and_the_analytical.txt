UNIT 9: Generative AI vs Predictive AI – The Creative and the Analytical
==================================================

SUMMARY:
- **Generative AI**: Focuses on creating new content—text, images, audio, and code—using models like GANs, transformers, and diffusion networks.
- **Predictive AI**: Designed to forecast future outcomes based on historical data patterns, used in business analytics, finance, fraud detection, and healthcare.
- **Use Cases Comparison**:
  - **Generative**: Text generation, image synthesis, video creation, music composition, product design, and personalization.
  - **Predictive**: Demand forecasting, customer behavior prediction, fraud detection, financial modeling, and marketing optimization.
- **Training Requirements**: Generative AI requires high-quality, diverse data; Predictive AI requires well-labeled historical data.
- **Limitations**: Generative AI may hallucinate or carry bias; Predictive AI may lack creativity and struggle with novel scenarios.
- **Tools**:
  - **Generative**: ChatGPT, Copilot, AlphaCode, DALL·E 3, Claude, Stable Diffusion, etc.
  - **Predictive**: Tableau, Marketing Evolution (MEVO), Improvado, etc.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Both raise concerns around data privacy, transparency, bias, and environmental impact.
