  "title": "Remove Bias from Your Data and Algorithms",
  "summary": "AI systems, while powerful, are only as good as the data and design choices behind them. Removing bias is not just a technical challenge—it requires intentional planning, cultural awareness, and collaboration. Biases in AI can result in unfair or inaccurate outcomes, especially when certain groups are overrepresented or excluded from datasets. Teams must recognize that biases stem from both data and human assumptions, and that systems must be evaluated continuously as social values evolve. Conducting premortems, identifying problematic patterns early, and building inclusive review processes are all essential strategies for ethical AI development.",
