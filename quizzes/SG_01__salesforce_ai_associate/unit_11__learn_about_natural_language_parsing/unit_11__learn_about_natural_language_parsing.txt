UNIT 11: Learn About Natural Language Parsing
==================================================

SUMMARY:
- **Definition**: Natural Language Parsing refers to techniques used by AI systems to analyze and derive meaning from human language.
- **Elements of Natural Language**:
  - **Vocabulary**: The words we use
  - **Grammar**: Rules governing sentence structure
  - **Syntax**: Word combinations according to grammar
  - **Semantics**: Meaning of words and phrases
  - **Pragmatics**: Context and intent behind language use
  - **Discourse**: Units larger than single phrases/sentences
  - **Phonetics**: Sounds made during communication
  - **Morphology**: How word parts combine to form new words
- **Parsing Techniques**:
  - **Segmentation**: Breaking text into meaningful sections
  - **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or tokens
  - **Stemming**: Reducing words to root forms (less accurate)
  - **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to base form using grammar context (more accurate)
  - **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning roles to words
  - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying people, places, dates, etc.
  - **Semantic Parsing**: Extracting meaning through grammatical analysis
- **Analysis Techniques**:
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining emotional tone
  - **Intent Analysis**: Identifying purpose behind text
  - **Context/Discourse Analysis**: Using surrounding information to resolve ambiguity

QUESTIONS:

   C) Morphology
   D) Sentiment
   - **Answer: B**
   Answer: B

3. What is the difference between stemming and lemmatization?
   A) Stemming finds parts of speech, while lemmatization finds named entities
   B) Stemming removes punctuation; lemmatization finds sentence structure
   C) Stemming cuts words to a rough root form; lemmatization finds accurate root words based on context

   Answer: C

5. Why is context analysis important in NLP?
   A) It makes tokenization more efficient
   B) It enables compression of output
   C) It helps interpret meaning based on the broader situation
   D) It ensures longer sentences are broken down
   - **Answer: C**
   Answer: C

6. What is the goal of intent analysis in NLP?
   A) To detect spelling mistakes
   B) To analyze tone and emotion
   C) To determine the purpose or goal behind a user's words
   D) To replace missing punctuation
   - **Answer: C**
   Answer: C
