  "summary": "- **Definition**: Natural Language Parsing refers to techniques used by AI systems to analyze and derive meaning from human language.\n- **Elements of Natural Language**:\n  - **Vocabulary**: The words we use\n  - **Grammar**: Rules governing sentence structure\n  - **Syntax**: Word combinations according to grammar\n  - **Semantics**: Meaning of words and phrases\n  - **Pragmatics**: Context and intent behind language use\n  - **Discourse**: Units larger than single phrases/sentences\n  - **Phonetics**: Sounds made during communication\n  - **Morphology**: How word parts combine to form new words\n- **Parsing Techniques**:\n  - **Segmentation**: Breaking text into meaningful sections\n  - **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or tokens\n  - **Stemming**: Reducing words to root forms (less accurate)\n  - **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to base form using grammar context (more accurate)\n  - **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning roles to words\n  - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying people, places, dates, etc.\n  - **Semantic Parsing**: Extracting meaning through grammatical analysis\n- **Analysis Techniques**:\n  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining emotional tone\n  - **Intent Analysis**: Identifying purpose behind text\n  - **Context/Discourse Analysis**: Using surrounding information to resolve ambiguity",
