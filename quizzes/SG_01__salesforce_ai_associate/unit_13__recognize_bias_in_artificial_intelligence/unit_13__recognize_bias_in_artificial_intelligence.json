  "title": "Recognize Bias in Artificial Intelligence",
  "summary": "Bias in AI can lead to inaccurate, unfair, or harmful outcomes if not properly identified and mitigated. Bias enters through human assumptions, incomplete or skewed training data, flawed model design, or lack of diverse team input. Understanding how these biases manifest — from measurement to automation to survivorship bias — is critical to designing fair, ethical AI systems. Legal compliance is necessary but not always sufficient; ethical considerations must guide the use of protected data categories. Organizations must actively detect and remove bias while giving stakeholders feedback mechanisms to reduce harm and build trust.",
