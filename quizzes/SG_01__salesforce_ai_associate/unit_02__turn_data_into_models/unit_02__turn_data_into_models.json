  "summary": "- **Machine Learning vs. Traditional Algorithms**: ML trains systems using data, whereas traditional algorithms explicitly program rules.\n- **Limitations of Hand-coding**: Many tasks involve numerous unknown or complex rules, making ML necessary.\n- **Learning Process**: Machine Learning involves training models by adjusting numerical \"weights\" assigned to inputs based on historical data.\n- **Data Types**:\n  - **Structured Data**: Clearly organized and labeled data, suitable for supervised learning, where input-output pairs are known and verifiable.\n  - **Unstructured Data**: Data without explicit labels or organization (such as images or text), suitable for unsupervised learning, where AI identifies patterns without predefined outcomes.",
