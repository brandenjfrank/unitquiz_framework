### Unit 2: Turn Data into Models ### ###

### Summary ###
### Summary ###
Summary:
Artificial Intelligence models are increasingly built using Machine Learning (ML)—training systems with large amounts of data instead of relying solely on manually programmed rules (hand-coded algorithms). Handcrafted algorithms are limited because some problems are too complex or have too many exceptions to capture effectively in a simple rule-based system.
Machine Learning involves training models by adjusting numerical "weights" assigned to inputs based on historical data. Through repeated guess-and-check cycles, the computer improves its predictions by discovering which factors (inputs) most significantly impact the outcomes (outputs).
There are two main types of data:
Structured Data: Clearly organized and labeled data, suitable for supervised learning, where input-output pairs are known and verifiable.
Unstructured Data: Data without explicit labels or organization (such as images or text), suitable for unsupervised learning, where AI identifies patterns without predefined outcomes.
Key Takeaways:
Machine Learning vs. Algorithms: ML trains systems using data, whereas traditional algorithms explicitly program rules.
Complexity Limits Hand-coding: Many tasks involve numerous unknown or complex rules, making ML necessary.
Structured vs. Unstructured Data:
Structured data (tables, labeled spreadsheets) enables supervised learning.
Unstructured data (images, text) is used for unsupervised learning.

### Unit 3: Understand the Need for Neural Networks ### ###

### Summary ###
### Summary ###
Summary:
Neural networks allow AI systems to recognize complex relationships between input data and outcomes, crucial for sophisticated predictions and classifications that match human-like reasoning. They enable computers to discover what matters in varied scenarios, connecting real-world human needs (easier, faster tasks with fewer errors) to intelligent solutions, such as natural language understanding.
Initially, simple AI models assign a single importance (weight) to each input, but this oversimplifies real-world scenarios. For example, rain's impact on shopping depends heavily on whether it's a weekday or weekend. Neural networks solve this by creating multiple interconnected nodes to represent unique combinations of inputs (weekend, time, rain).
By combining these scenarios into a single model with multiple nodes, each scenario can be assigned a bias (adjustment) based on its unique influence, making predictions more precise.
Each node adjusts the final output based on biases and additional weights. This interconnected structure, with nodes and layers, forms a neural network.
Adding more layers and nodes to neural networks creates "deep learning," enabling the AI to discover hidden relationships by making multiple leaps of inference, similar to human reasoning.
Designing neural networks involves choosing the number of nodes, layers, and specialized mathematical methods tailored to the task. Although powerful, neural networks are often "black boxes," making predictions without clear explanations for each connection or weight's significance.
Key Takeaways:
Neural networks allow AI to handle complex, scenario-dependent data relationships.
Simple AI models with one-weight-per-input oversimplify real-world scenarios.
Neural networks use interconnected nodes and layers, enabling more precise predictions.
Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple layers, capable of discovering hidden patterns.
Neural networks are often "black boxes," making decisions without clear explanations for each connection.
